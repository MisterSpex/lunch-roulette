Command Line App
================

Lunch Roulette is a command line application that always requires a CSV file with staff "features", such as their team and specialty and start date. It is run using the ruby executable and specifying the staff via a CSV file:

```ruby
ruby lib/lunch_roulette.rb data/output/20200817-112120.csv
```

CSV Output
==========

Lunch Roulette will generate a new CSV in data/output each time it is run. The filenames are unique and based on the current date.
